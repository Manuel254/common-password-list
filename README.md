"# common-password-list" 

Context
Back in 2009, a company named RockYou was hacked. This wouldn't have been too much of a problem if they hadn't stored all of their passwords unencrypted, in plain text for an attacker to see. They downloaded a list of all the passwords and made it publically available.
